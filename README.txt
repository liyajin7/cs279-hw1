This prototype was designed using the code from this example:
https://codingthesmartway.com/building-a-vanilla-javascript-todo-app-from-start-to-finish-ep-1-introduction-project-setup/

I started the prototype by installing the Live Server plugin on VSCode
(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer,
25m+ downloads and 4.5 stars).

After the plugin is installed, go to the index.html file and right-click
anywhere in the text editor. Within the dropdown menu, there will be an
option titled "Open with Live Server [L O]". (What lives in the keyboard
shortcut brackets depends on your OS: on Mac, you'll see the command
symbol before the L and O).

The prototype should automatically open in your default browser! Please
email me at liyajin@college.harvard.edu if you have any issues. Thanks :)
